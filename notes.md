## GitHub Assignment

- The "git fetch" command allows you to pull down changes from the origin branches so you can then compare and merge them into your local versions of the same branches.
- Forks are local copies of a repo, particularly one that you don't own or have direct editing access to. 
- Pull requests are how you can submit suggested changes to a forked repo or simply to another branch within a repo.
